Python basics 


Python is a general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. 
It emphasizes readability and simplicity, 
making it easy for beginners to learn and powerful enough for experts to build complex systems.

Key Features :
1. Easy to Read and Write - Python's syntax is simple and close to English.

2. Interpreted Language - You don't need to compile your code; Python runs it directly.

3. Dynamically Typed - You don't need to declare variable types explicitly.

4. Extensive Libraries - Python has huge libraries for almost everything:

            Data analysis: pandas, numpy

            Machine learning: scikit-learn, tensorflow

            Web development: Django, Flask

            Automation: os, selenium

5. Cross-Platform - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

6. Object-Oriented - Supports OOP concepts like classes and inheritance.
