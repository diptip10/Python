# Datatypes in python (general)- Python is dynamically typed language

# 1. Number - integer(int) 10,20
#             float 10.4, 20.5
#             complex (10+j)
# 2. String- str- 'Python', 'data'
# Boolean- bool - True(1), False (0)

eid = 1    # int
ename ='Riya'  # str
esal = 10000.45   # float

# To check the type of variable we have type() function
print(type(eid))
print(type(ename))
print(type(esal))
